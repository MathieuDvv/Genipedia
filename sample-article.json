However, the field of AI research was founded at a workshop held on the campus of <a class='wiki-link' href='?q=Dartmouth College'>Dartmouth College</a> during the summer of 1956.</p><p>The early years of AI were marked by great enthusiasm and significant progress. Between the 1950s and 1970s, AI research tackled and solved problems that were intellectually difficult for humans but relatively straightforward for computers. However, researchers encountered the <a class='wiki-link' href='?q=AI Winter'>AI Winter</a> in the 1970s when many AI projects failed to deliver on their promises.</p>"
